_**Agent (model default, mode Agent)**_

I'll help you create meta tags for all the appropriate pages and a refactor script to apply them automatically. Let me first examine the current structure and then create the necessary components.


---

<tool-use data-tool-type="task" data-tool-name="todo_write">
<details><summary>Tool use: **todo_write** • Todo List</summary>

- [-] Examine current page structure and metadata implementation
- [ ] Create metadata configuration for all pages
- [ ] Create refactor script to apply metadata automatically
- [ ] Create separate server-side pages for client-side handled pages
- [ ] Test and validate metadata implementation

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file** • Read file: app/layout.tsx</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file** • Read file: app/page.tsx</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file** • Read file: app/product/page.tsx</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file** • Read file: app/solutions/page.tsx</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file** • Read file: app/pricing/page.tsx</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file** • Read file: app/security/page.tsx</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file** • Read file: app/docs/page.tsx</summary>

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="task" data-tool-name="todo_write">
<details><summary>Tool use: **todo_write** • Todo List</summary>

- [x] Examine current page structure and metadata implementation
- [ ] Create metadata configuration for all pages
- [ ] Create refactor script to apply metadata automatically
- [ ] Create separate server-side pages for client-side handled pages
- [ ] Test and validate metadata implementation

</details>
</tool-use>

---

Now I can see the current structure. I notice that some pages already have metadata implemented (Home, Product, Solutions, Pricing, Security, Docs), but I need to create metadata for all the other pages in the navigation structure. Let me create a comprehensive metadata configuration and refactor script.


---

<tool-use data-tool-type="task" data-tool-name="todo_write">
<details><summary>Tool use: **todo_write** • Todo List</summary>

- [x] Examine current page structure and metadata implementation
- [-] Create metadata configuration for all pages
- [ ] Create refactor script to apply metadata automatically
- [ ] Create separate server-side pages for client-side handled pages
- [ ] Test and validate metadata implementation

</details>
</tool-use>

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="write" data-tool-name="write">

<details><summary>Tool use: **code_edit** • Edit file: app/lib/metadata-config.ts</summary>
