**Implementing gradient borders**

I need to add a gradient border around images in the app's page. It seems like we want this as a reusable CSS class, since we're using Tailwind v4 and have a globals.css file. I'll create a utility class like .gradient-border for the wrapping div, ensuring it has padding, a background gradient, rounded corners, and overflow hidden. We already have a parent div with these properties, so I'll add the new class there and make minimal edits. I'll set up the CSS accordingly in globals.css.
**Creating a reusable gradient border**

The request is for a reusable CSS class, so I can abstract Tailwind classes into a utility class. I plan to add a .gradient-border class in globals.css with the correct properties like gradient background, padding, and rounded corners.

I need to check Tailwind v4 to ensure I'm using the right syntax. My CSS will apply a linear gradient and set up a child container to have the right background while managing overflow. It’s essential to follow the rules about rounding to ensure it looks clean!
**Adjusting border structure**

In this case, I need to ensure that the border is on the parent element. The parent should have overflow-hidden, while the child should not be rounded. I’ll create a wrapper div with the class 'gradient-border overflow-hidden rounded-lg'.

For the inner div that contains the image, I'll remove any rounding and ensure it fills the space, avoiding double rounding. We need to update all five sections with image containers by wrapping them accordingly and adjusting the padding to fit our design. The overflow-hidden should stay on the parent to comply with the rules!
**Implementing CSS variables**

I need to ensure that the Image element maintains its fill. I plan to implement CSS variable colors, so I should check the globals.css file to see what color variables are available. It's important to verify that I am using the right variables in my CSS to ensure consistency and proper styling. This step will help make the styling more manageable and adaptable for future changes. Let’s dive into globals.css and see what we've got!</details></think>

---

I'll add a reusable `gradient-border` utility in `app/globals.css`, then wrap each image container in `app/product/page.tsx` with this class and adjust rounding/overflow per our styling rules. Let me open the stylesheet and the page to make these edits.

**Considering CSS adjustments**

I need to ensure that the inner child inherits properties correctly by using overflow-hidden. I think about adopting the `.gradient-border` class for a reusable wrapper, keeping the inner utility as `.gradient-border-content`. Since they asked for a single class, I can make minimal changes by wrapping the existing `.relative ... rounded-lg` structure. 

The parent should have `rounded-lg` and `overflow-hidden`, while setting the inner child to have `rounded-none`, moving from `overflow-hidden` as well. I’ll adjust these properties accordingly.
**Implementing image sections with CSS**

I’m focusing on adding four image sections to the product page by wrapping the existing image div, like in the line with `relative ... rounded-lg`. I’ll create a new wrapping div and add CSS rules for `.gradient-border` in `globals.css`. 

This class will include a border radius and a background with a conic gradient, though I need to keep it consistent with the theme. I’ll update `globals.css` first, followed by modifications in `product/page.tsx`. I'll also ensure accessibility guidelines are followed, keeping text sizes standard.
**Finalizing gradient-border CSS**

I want to implement the CSS for the `.gradient-border`. I'll set padding to 2px and use `border-radius: inherit` to avoid conflicts, while ensuring the wrapper controls the overall radius. Since the page uses `rounded-lg` set to 0.5rem, I think it’s best not to match this exactly. Instead, I’ll handle the radius through the Tailwind class applied to the wrapper.

The background will be a linear gradient, and I’ll ensure the inner element has a background set to `var(--background)` to display border edges properly. I’m considering adding another div inside for additional content too.
**Structuring the wrapper and inner container**

So, the pattern I'm implementing involves a wrapper with 1px padding and a gradient background, along with an inner container that has a background color to mask the content inside. Since the image covers the entire area and is set to absolute, the inner container needs to inherit the border radius and have its background set to `var(--background)`.

I’ll structure it like this:

```html
<div class="gradient-border rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
  <div class="relative w-full ... rounded-none"> 
```

I don't need to add extra classes for the inner background. The overflow-hidden on the wrapper will only affect the inner container, revealing the 1px border around it without clipping the gradient. Everything looks good!
**Implementing wrapper classes and updates**

I’m focusing on adding the wrapper classes to update for the four images at lines 27, 52, 77, 102, and 127. I’ll wrap each of these accordingly. Then, I need to apply the patch to `globals.css`, adding the new class at the bottom, perhaps under Special Effects, before modifying `app/product/page.tsx`.

Even though this task is relatively small, the spec suggests including status updates and using a todo list for multi-step tasks. However, since this is a simple two-file edit, I think I’ll skip the todos and focus on implementing micro-updates while I make these changes. Let's get started!</details></think>

I'll add a reusable `.gradient-border` class in `app/globals.css`, then wrap the image containers in `app/product/page.tsx` with this class and adjust rounding/overflow accordingly.

**Updating product page layout**

I need to modify the product/page.tsx to wrap the image containers with a gradient border. The user has this specific file open, so I'll focus on that. Each image is currently in a div with specific styles, but to add the gradient border, I’ll wrap the existing containers in a new div that has the gradient-border class, ensuring the inner images don’t have rounded corners. I’ll check multiple sections to update all five images, and then I’ll make sure to run lints on the edited files after that.
**Updating status summary**

I need to provide a status update and a summary of the changes made. Since this is just a small adjustment, I don't think it's necessary to create any new to-dos for it. I’ll keep things straightforward and let the user know what’s been accomplished. Let’s move forward with wrapping everything up and sharing the update clearly so that they’re informed and everything is documented properly.</details></think>

---

I’m going to wrap each image container in `app/product/page.tsx` with a parent `div` that uses the new `gradient-border` class and `rounded-lg overflow-hidden`, and remove redundant rounding on the inner container to follow the rounding rule. Then I’ll check for any linter issues.

**Inspecting JSX structure**

It seems like we broke JSX because of mismatched tags. This happened due to changes in our patch that altered the structure and led to extra closing divs being misaligned. I need to open the file and check those sections to make sure everything is properly nested. Let’s read through the file to see the current content and identify where the issues are!</details></think>

---

I'm going to open the updated `app/product/page.tsx` to correct mismatched JSX tags introduced by the wrapper divs and ensure proper nesting.

**Maintaining code formatting**

I need to be careful with the indentation and ensure I don’t change the indentation type. It looks like the file uses two spaces for indentation, and I want to keep that consistent. So, I’ll stick to two spaces while updating each section block. My focus now is on crafting the patch while making sure everything remains formatted correctly. It's crucial for readability and maintaining the integrity of the code!</details></think>

---

I’m going to fix the JSX structure in `app/product/page.tsx` to ensure each section’s grid has exactly two children: the image wrapper and the text column, with properly matched tags. Then I’ll re-run lints.

**Inspecting syntax errors**

It looks like we still have syntax errors due to extra closing tags in the earlier lines. I need to inspect the specified lines, particularly around numbers 70 to 110, to identify any misplaced closing braces. 

I've already removed some stray closing divs before, but there might still be extras lurking around. 

For the first section after hero (lines 24-49), it appears that the structure includes a section, grid div, image block, text block, and various close tags. It's important to clarify what each closing tag corresponds to so I can fix any issues properly.
**Identifying extra closings**

It looks like I’ve found the issue with the extra closing tags. The opening tags show that line 26 opens the "order-1" div, and line 27 opens a gradient div. When I reach line 31, it appears to close the inner div, but it’s also closing the gradient container. 

Line 32 closes something, but it’s unnecessary, so line 33 ends up closing the grid prematurely, which is a problem. I’ll fix each section to ensure everything is correctly nested. The first product section structure should be:

<section>
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="order-1"> ...image wrapper... </div>
    <div class="order-2"> ...text... </div>
  </div>
</section>

It’s important to maintain balance, as this kind of issue repeats in other sections too.
**Editing stray closing lines**

I need to edit the file to remove the stray closing lines. Specifically, in the first section, I should take out line 33, which is the </div> after the closure of the order-1 div. 

To be thorough, I’ll confirm the sequence by reviewing lines 26 to 35 again. It’s important to ensure everything is in order, so I’ll reopen the file to check those exact lines in that section. That way, I can make sure the structure is correct.</details></think>

**Debugging extra closing divs**

I’m noticing that we have some extra closing divs in our code. Specifically, after the third inner div, we appear to close twice, suggesting an extra closing div at line 32. This stray closing div seems to be closing something that hasn’t been opened. 

When I compare the structure starting from line 25, it looks like the closures align correctly until line 32, where the issue arises. I’m curious why linters are flagging this; I’ll need to check lines around 77, 80 as well.
**Identifying stray closing divs**

I need to check the later sections of the code because I suspect there might be similar stray closing divs. It’s important that I carefully scroll through and look for any inconsistencies or extra closures that could lead to errors. I want to be thorough because these issues can cause unexpected behavior in the layout. By addressing these stray divs now, I hope to ensure the code works as intended. Let's see what I can find!</details></think>

**Identifying JSX Issues**

I need to address linter errors, specifically the complaint about not being able to find the name 'section.' That usually happens when JSX tags are unbalanced, which makes TypeScript confused about the context. After reviewing the code structure, I see it goes: section > div.grid > div.order-1 (image). I'll manually check the first section from lines 24-47. It looks like there's possibly an extra closing tag between lines 31 and 32, so I’ll count those tags to confirm.
**Examining Closing Tags**

I've spotted an issue where a `</div>` closing tag indicates the end of section A. Line 33 opens `order-2`, which fits since the grid should have two children. After examining further, everything seems fine until I hit line 77, where the linter detects problems. In section 2, lines 52-61 show extra closures at lines 59 and 60. This double closing indicates a problem where I need to ensure that for `order-1`, I'm closing the inner wrapper correctly without adding unnecessary extra tags.
**Aligning Closing Tags**

I've found that we currently have three closing tags correctly in place: close inner, close wrapper, and close order-1. For section 2, everything looks good with the order of openings and closings. However, in section 4, I discovered an extra closing tag after the wrapper close. I see three closing tags are correct for sections 3 and 5, yet TypeScript is still throwing errors. It mentions not finding names like 'div' and 'section,' which often happens when there's a stray closing tag disrupting the TSX context.
**Checking for Extra Closures**

It looks like there might have been an extra closing tag in the first section at line 32 where I closed `order-1`. Line 33 has a stray closing tag that I believe we already addressed. So in my first patch, I should double-check the section: lines 25 through 49 all close properly. The second section’s class list looks good with md:grid-cols-2 and sm:items-start items-center. However, I noticed the potential issue with the unused `CTAButton` import, which could contribute to the linter errors.
**Troubleshooting Linter Errors**

The linter errors at line 160 suggest potential mismatched indentations of div tags. There's an extra closing tag right after the wrapper that's been noted already, likely causing issues. I should also consider if self-closing `<br>` tags were misunderstood. The errors about not finding names like 'section' and 'className' usually occur when TypeScript misreads JSX due to unclosed comments or stray tags. I’ll inspect all sections for proper structure, focusing on lines 77, 80, 104, and so on, while considering whitespace and unnecessary closures that could confuse the parser. It could also help to compare with the original file's structure.
**Addressing Extra Closures**

In the first section, after the image block, the closing tags are correct with three closures for inner, wrapper, and order-1. However, in section 4, there are still extra closing tags noted around lines 112-114. It seems I have a correct sequence, but I'm puzzled by the linter error at line 104 that says it cannot find 'div.' This might suggest a prior issue in the code causing confusion. Given the errors, I plan to reconstruct the sections, carefully ensuring consistent structure and avoiding significant changes while I rewrite from line 22 to the end.</details></think>

- I added a reusable gradient border utility and applied it to all product images.

What I did:
- Created `.gradient-border` in `app/globals.css` for a consistent gradient border.
- Wrapped each image container in `app/product/page.tsx` with a `div` using `gradient-border rounded-lg overflow-hidden`, and set the actual image holder to `rounded-none` to honor the parent rounding as per the rounding rule.

Code references:
```255:263:app/globals.css
.accent-border {
  border-left: 4px solid var(--accent);
}

/* Reusable gradient border wrapper */
.gradient-border {
  /* Apply this to a rounded container. Keep child unrounded. */
  padding: 1px; /* visual border width */
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--accent), color-mix(in srgb, var(--foreground) 25%, transparent));
}
```

Example usage in `app/product/page.tsx`:
```26:33:app/product/page.tsx
<div className="order-1">
  <div className="gradient-border rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
    <div className="relative w-full aspect-[16/10] md:aspect-auto md:h-[60vh] overflow-hidden rounded-none">
      <Image src="/product/picture2.png" alt="Chat & Meetings preview" fill className="object-contain" priority sizes="(min-width: 768px) 40vw, 90vw" />
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

- All JSX structures are valid and lints pass.

Note:
- If you want this applied across other pages, I can create a small reusable `ImageFrame` component in `/components` to encapsulate the structure and classes, then update other pages to use it.

_**User (2025-09-28 09:43Z)**_

The background around the images in @page.tsx must then always have a consistent amount of visible background around all edges then, currently there's only padding around top and bottom edges and its inconsistent with image aspect ratio

_**Agent (model default, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
**Adjusting gradient borders**

I need to make sure the visible background space within the gradient border is consistent all around. Right now, the inner container has a fixed height, causing issue with top and bottom padding depending on the image used. To fix this, I'll add padding to the content box and ensure the canvas uses background color all around. Alternatively, I can create a utility class for padding within the gradient border for uniformity. I’ll suggest something like `.image-frame-inner { background: var(--background); padding: 0.5rem; }`.
**Maintaining consistent aspect ratios**

I need to make sure the aspect ratio maintains consistent spacing around images, which can differ in content. To achieve equal padding edges within the frame, I should set a container that defines the aspect ratio and use a global CSS class equivalent to `p-3`. Tailwind is in use, but globals.css is preferred for this. I’ll also add an inner wrapper providing padding all around the relative container. Finally, I should remove any fixed height to unify aspect ratio across breakpoints for consistent padding.
**Ensuring consistent background visibility**

I need to provide a consistent visible background around images, regardless of their aspect ratios. Using object-contain can leave blank spaces, so I’ll define a constant internal padding of around 12px. I’m considering updating globals.css to add a new class, `.image-frame`, to replace the current gradient-border and its padding, or modifying the existing one. Additionally, in product/page.tsx, I’ll adjust the structure for a cleaner look, ensuring `overflow-hidden` and rounded settings are correctly applied to avoid any visual discrepancies.
**Fine-tuning the frame settings**

I need to be careful with the frame-inner so that it isn't rounded, as that could lead to mismatched radii. If it weren't rounded, its square background might poke into the parent's rounded corners. Thankfully, since the parent has overflow-hidden, those corners will be clipped. I’ll remove any fixed heights and use a consistent aspect ratio across breakpoints, ensuring that padding remains uniform around the image. To create a visible background, I should wrap the Image in a container with padding, which will keep a constant gap around the image.
**Structuring the image frame**

I need to ensure that the Image with fill uses absolute positioning correctly. The image will fill the content box, but that may obscure the padding as it covers the area. To create a visible background gap, I'll use a wrapper with padding and a background. The new structure will involve a gradient-border, then a frame-inner with padding and background, followed by a relative container for the Image. I’ll remove fixed heights and maintain consistent aspect ratios throughout all breakpoints. Finally, I'll update globals.css with the necessary classes for the frame. Let's proceed!</details></think>

---

I’m going to add a new `.image-frame-inner` utility in `app/globals.css` to provide uniform inner padding and background, then update each image block in `app/product/page.tsx` to use this inner wrapper and remove the fixed `md:h-[60vh]` so the spacing is consistent on all edges. I’ll run lints after the edits.

I adjusted the image frames to ensure a consistent visible background around all edges.

- Added `image-frame-inner` in `app/globals.css` with uniform padding and background.
- Updated each product image block in `app/product/page.tsx`:
  - Structure: `gradient-border` → `image-frame-inner` → fixed-aspect container → `Image`
  - Removed the previous fixed `md:h-[60vh]` so the padding remains uniform regardless of viewport and image aspect.
  - Kept `aspect-[16/10]` for predictable layout and consistent spacing.

Code references:
```300:309:app/globals.css
/* Inner frame to ensure consistent spacing around media */
.image-frame-inner {
  background: var(--background);
  padding: 0.75rem; /* 12px uniform gap on all sides */
}
```

Example usage:
```26:34:app/product/page.tsx
<div className="order-1">
  <div className="gradient-border rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
    <div className="image-frame-inner rounded-none">
      <div className="relative w-full aspect-[16/10] overflow-hidden rounded-none">
        <Image src="/product/picture2.png" alt="Chat & Meetings preview" fill className="object-contain" priority sizes="(min-width: 768px) 40vw, 90vw" />
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

- Lints pass on changed files. If you want this pattern site-wide, I can extract a reusable `ImageFrame` component in `/components` and refactor other pages.

_**User (2025-09-28 09:43Z)**_

Still no horizontal padding, the w-full of the images must still apply, but not override this padding

---

_**Agent (model default, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
**Analyzing container width and padding**

I'm considering the aspect container which might use aspect-[16/10], but it seems like in a width-constrained grid column, the container's width equals the parent's content box width. I need to keep in mind that padding reduces the inner content area. The user mentions no horizontal padding; it could be due to the default display settings of the inner elements. Also, the background might appear the same as the page, making it seem like there's no padding when they actually want a visible background gap.
**Examining padding and background visibility**

The user wants a visible gap between the gradient border and the image content, which is essentially our padding. However, if the parent page's background color is the same, that padding won't be noticeable. They desire a consistent visible background gap around the images, so maybe we should consider using a different neutral surface color. To ensure the inner padding doesn’t get overridden, we might apply padding to a wrapper or adjust the child width using calculations. I think this should all be manageable!
**Analyzing horizontal padding issues**

The user says there’s still no horizontal padding, which might be due to the aspect ratio squeezing on smaller screens. With an aspect ratio of 16/10 and object-contain, I notice top and bottom padding but not left and right. They want the padding to remain visible outside the image regardless of object-contain. Perhaps the image is positioned incorrectly, causing it to extend under the padding. I’m wondering if there could be CSS conflicts, especially with the display settings in the image frame. It's a bit puzzling!
**Examining the aspect container setup**

I think the aspect container has the class "w-full aspect-[16/10]" and might be set to "overflow-hidden rounded-none." The user insists that "w-full" should apply, but not override the padding. To fix this, I need to ensure the inner content has a width of 100% while keeping box-sizing in mind. It seems like the padding appears to be on the parent container and might not be visually prominent due to background matching. Maybe I should propose moving the padding to a different container that has rounded corners!
**Revising padding and container styles**

It looks like the same color as the page makes the padding appear invisible. To tackle this, I can add an inner container with the class 'frame-content', ensuring it has a width of 100% while also applying 'box-content' for padding management. I'll adjust the CSS for .image-frame-inner to use 'display: grid' and 'place-items: center', while also making sure padding is enforced. Removing 'overflow-hidden' might help reveal the padding and ensure the background shows properly. I'll also increase padding for better visibility and check all blocks for consistency.</details></think>

---

I'll update the `.image-frame-inner` CSS to enforce horizontal padding by using content-box sizing so the `w-full` child doesn't collapse the side padding. Then I'll confirm lints.

- Updated `.image-frame-inner` to use `box-sizing: content-box` so the inner `div` with `w-full` and the absolutely-filled `Image` no longer consume the horizontal padding area. This ensures uniform left/right padding remains visible without changing your layout or width behavior.

If you’d like extra control per breakpoint, I can add responsive padding tokens to `.image-frame-inner` (e.g., `padding: 0.5rem;` mobile and `1rem` on md+).

_**User (2025-09-28 09:43Z)**_

Now the border is really thin, maybe 1px despite the css

---

_**Agent (model default, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
**Modifying gradient borders**

I need to address the thinness of the gradient border. It looks like the user mentioned it appears as 1px, even with the CSS in place, which may be due to changes they made. They want a thicker border, so I'll set up a CSS variable for border width in the .gradient-border class, defaulting to 2px or 3px. I could also consider changing the padding from 1px to 3px for simplicity. There’s an inconsistency with the inner padding, but I won’t revert it unless they ask.
**Updating gradient border thickness**

I’m looking to set a thicker value for the gradient border. The minimal approach would be to increase the padding to 3px to ensure it reflects consistently. I want to make sure the background clip is handled correctly since the gradient may appear desaturated. I'll update the `app/globals.css` by changing the padding for .gradient-border to 3px or 4px. Since the user just wants a thicker border, I’ll go with 3px as the default change across the board and implement it accordingly.</details></think>

---

I'll increase the gradient border thickness by updating the padding on the `.gradient-border` utility to 3px so it renders visibly thicker everywhere the class is used.

- Increased the gradient border thickness by setting `.gradient-border` padding from 1px to 3px so the border is clearly visible.

If you want an even thicker frame, bump to 4–6px. If you prefer using Tailwind spacing scale, we can swap to a utility approach or expose a CSS variable like `--frame-border-width` to tune per page.

_**User (2025-09-28 09:43Z)**_

Make the child image as rounded as the parent gradient border always

---

_**Agent (model default, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
**Matching Image Borders**

I need to make sure the child image matches the rounded corners of the parent gradient border. The current structure includes several layers, and I realize I should apply a consistent border-radius to the inner wrappers. Using `border-radius: inherit` can help with this! I’ll create a new CSS class called `.rounded-inherit` and apply it to the relevant divs. I'll also ensure the overflow settings are correct to clip the image well. Just fine-tuning to make sure everything looks cohesive!
**Implementing CSS Changes**

I need to edit `globals.css` to include the `.rounded-inherit` utility. It will be applied to `.image-frame-inner` to set `border-radius: inherit`. We’re using Tailwind v4, so I want to be cautious about changing class names. I’m thinking of updating `app/product/page.tsx` to replace `rounded-none` with `rounded-inherit` for both the image frame and inner container. I can just add the new class in CSS, but need to ensure the indentation is correct and run my lints afterward. Time to apply those patches!</details></think>

---

I’m going to add a reusable `.rounded-inherit` CSS utility and apply it to the image wrappers in `app/product/page.tsx` so the child frame and image container inherit the parent’s rounding and always match the gradient border radius. Then I’ll verify lints.

- Added `.rounded-inherit` and applied `border-radius: inherit` to `.image-frame-inner` and the inner image wrapper so the child corners always match the parent gradient border’s radius.
- Updated all image blocks in `app/product/page.tsx` to use `rounded-inherit` on the inner wrappers with `overflow-hidden`, keeping the parent `rounded-lg` as the single source of truth for corner radius.

This guarantees the image corners stay perfectly aligned with the gradient border, regardless of changes to the parent radius.

_**User (2025-09-28 09:43Z)**_

I just want the images to fully take up the image-frame-inner container, for it to be image-border, with variable aspect ratios, for them to just take up the size avaliable

_**Agent (model default, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
**Modifying image display**

I need to adjust the CSS structure so that images completely fill the container, accommodating variable aspect ratios. I plan to set the image-frame-inner to define size with responsive width and auto height and change the image to use `object-cover` instead of `contain` to achieve this. The aspect constraints should be removed. Also, the parent’s height needs to be set or determined by its content since it currently collapses. We want to ensure the images truly fit within the given space.
**Adjusting image responsiveness**

They want the image to fill the available space in the layout grid cell. I could set a minimum height for `.image-frame-inner`, like 60vh, but it seems they weren't keen on that before. Perhaps instead, I can use CSS aspect-ratio for a responsive minimum height. They likely want the image to stretch and crop as needed, so I'll go with `object-cover`. I’ll ensure `.image-frame-inner` has a responsive height, maybe set it to 100%, adjusting the outer grid context to provide the necessary height.
**Refining image structure**

I need to set the intermediate inner div `.relative h-full w-full` to position: relative, while positioning the `Image fill` absolutely within the parent's bounds. I'll ensure the wrapper is relative and set `.image-frame-inner` to height: 100%. It might be wise to remove the extra inner aspect div and simplify to just have `.image-frame-inner` relative with `Image fill` using `object-cover`. I also want to ensure consistent heights in the grid column and stretch the image wrapper, so I can add h-full to the image column and address any alignment issues.
**Adjusting grid item behavior**

I noticed that if the alignment is set to items-center, the content ends up not being stretched. To ensure the image column wrapper fills the available height, I can add self-stretch to it. Currently, the grid container uses items-center, which aligns items vertically, but switching to items-stretch will help the child fill properly. I also want to set the image wrapper height to 100% while maintaining minimal changes. In globals.css, I’ll make `.image-frame-inner` box-sizing border-box and remove padding to standardize its dimensions.
**Finalizing layout adjustments**

It's important to ensure that `.gradient-border` has `border-radius: inherit`, which seems fine. In page.tsx, I’ll change each image block's inner div, making `.image-frame-inner` have `relative w-full h-full`, while removing the extra inner div. I also want to set the Next/Image to use `className="object-cover"` for better fill, and add `className="self-stretch"` to the outer cell div with `order-1` to help it fill height. Finally, I’ll make necessary edits for the order adjustments and run the lints to check for issues.</details></think>

---

I'll update the CSS to make `.image-frame-inner` fill its parent and switch the image to object-cover. I'll also simplify the markup so the `Image` fills the `image-frame-inner` directly, and set the image column wrappers to self-stretch so they take up the available height within the grid. Then I'll check for lints.

- Changed `.image-frame-inner` to fill its parent (`width: 100%; height: 100%`) and be `relative` when needed by the filled image wrapper.
- Simplified the markup so the `Image` fills `.image-frame-inner` directly, and switched the image to `object-cover` so it fully occupies the available frame regardless of aspect ratio.
- Ensured the image column wrappers are `self-stretch` and parents `h-full` so the frame grows to the grid row height.

This gives you an “image-as-border” effect where the image always fills the inner frame, the gradient acts as the outer border, and variable aspect ratios are handled gracefully. If you want the image to fully contain without cropping, swap `object-cover` back to `object-contain`.

_**User (2025-09-28 09:43Z)**_

I want the parent div to conform to the size of the image, not for the image overflow to be cut off or anything

---

_**Agent (model default, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
**Adjusting image size handling**

I need to ensure the parent container sizes correctly to fit the image without cropping. Right now, using object-cover and fill may lead to unwanted cropping. The user wants the parent to conform to the image size, so I'll avoid using fill. Instead, I'll set explicit width and height for the Next.js Image component, allowing it to size responsively. By using object-contain and removing overflow settings, the inner container can adjust properly based on the image size.
**Adjusting image sizing approach**

I’m considering using `fill` with object-contain, but I need to ensure that the parent size wraps the image correctly. The simplest way is to remove fill and provide explicit `width` and `height` using the actual image dimensions, which I currently don’t have. I can also use `Image` by setting `fill={false}` and specifying `width` and `height`. This will allow it to calculate the correct aspect ratio, making sure the parent wraps the content based on the image size. I'll implement these changes in product/page.tsx.
**Exploring image sizing options**

I can choose 1600x900 to achieve a 16:9 aspect ratio, but since the user wants variable aspect ratios, I'll remove the `fill` option and apply a style of width: 100%; height: auto to maintain the intrinsic ratio. I can use public/product images, but I need to ensure I set the right generic dimensions, like `width={1200}` and `height={800}`, although they may not be perfect. I’ll stick with Next.js Image for optimization, keeping `fill` and object-contain, while adjusting the parent settings to ensure the height isn't constrained.
**Sizing parent based on images**

I'm considering whether to use CSS to size the parent based on the aspect ratio since the user wants variable options. My best approach is to set the `Image` width and height to the natural sizes of the images. Since the assets in the public folder vary, I can assume filenames like `updated_projects.png` might be 1600x900. I’ll implement by replacing `fill` with `width={1600}` and `height={900}`, using class `w-full h-auto`. I’ll also switch from `object-cover` to `object-contain` to avoid cropping, ensuring a perfect fit.
**Adjusting image frame settings**

I need to remove the `height: 100%` setting from `.image-frame-inner` in globals.css so that it wraps the image content instead of constraining it. That means I’ll keep the width at 100% but ensure the height is set to auto. I’ll also adjust the gradient-border by removing unnecessary height and ensuring the outer div doesn’t stretch. For the images, I'll set dimensions to 1600x1000, using class `w-full h-auto object-contain`. This should help maintain the intrinsic aspect ratio without distortion, allowing the parent to adapt to the image.</details></think>

---

I'll update the CSS to let the inner frame wrap content height (remove its fixed height) and change each Next.js Image to intrinsic sizing with width/height and responsive width so the parent conforms to the image. Then I’ll run lints.

**Adjusting image layout**

I need to ensure that the parent element conforms to the image size without overflowing. The user wants the parent's dimensions based on the image's intrinsic size, allowing for variable aspects. In a grid system, the width should be responsive while keeping the height auto, based on the image's aspect ratio. Since Next.js Image with fill affects document flow, I should prioritize intrinsic layout and set width and height properties, aiming for proper dimensions while maintaining responsiveness.
**Refining image layout**

I need to adjust some styling elements: I’ll remove self-stretch and h-full, and only keep overflow-hidden if it's necessary. The gradient-border is good to keep. The image-frame-inner should wrap content without a fixed height. I’ll implement these changes across four blocks and replace the Image component with numeric width and height, along with the className 'w-full h-auto object-cover' or 'object-contain' as needed. The user wants the parent to fit the image, so it's important to maintain the aspect ratio. Finally, I’ll add explicit width and height values like 1920x1080.
**Applying file changes**

I need to use apply_patch to edit the file, and then run the linting process. It’s also a good idea to adjust the CSS if necessary, but I’m thinking I shouldn’t make any more changes after that. I’ll implement these updates for each image accordingly. It's about keeping everything clean and ensuring the images display properly. Let’s make this process as seamless as possible!</details></think>

---

I'll update the image elements in `app/product/page.tsx` to use intrinsic sizing (`width`/`height` with `w-full h-auto`) and remove stretching classes so the parent conforms to the image's natural aspect ratio. Then I'll check lints.

- Switched each `Image` in `app/product/page.tsx` to intrinsic sizing with `width`/`height` plus `w-full h-auto`. This makes the parent `.image-frame-inner` and the outer `gradient-border` conform to the image’s natural aspect ratio while remaining responsive.
- Removed stretch/absolute-fill wrappers so nothing is cropped or cut off.
- Kept `rounded-inherit` so corners still match the gradient border.

If you want to avoid hardcoding `1600x900`, share the real pixel sizes of the assets and I’ll set those for perfect intrinsic layout and optimal CLS.
