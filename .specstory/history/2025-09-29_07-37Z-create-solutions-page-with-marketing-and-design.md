**Updating solutions page**

I need to implement a solutions page in my Next.js app. There’s already a placeholder at app/solutions/page.tsx. The user wants large placeholder images for cards, with sections for Marketing Teams, Design Teams, Software Teams, and Government & Public Sector. I’ll format the descriptions into bullet points. Each card will include a CTA: “See how it works →". Since we need a responsive grid, I’ll use Tailwind v4 and Next.js Image with placeholders, likely gray boxes. Let's do this!
**Creating image placeholders**

I can utilize images from the `/public` directory, although we don't have specific product images for solutions. The user requested "large placeholder images," so I might opt for neutral SVGs or gray rectangles for now. Using a `div` with an appropriate aspect ratio and background could work. While the Next.js Image component is crucial for performance, placeholders could be set up using a data URI. I’ll ensure to follow styling rules like Tailwind v4 and mobile-first design while including the CTA: “See how it works →," linking to relevant solution pages.
**Creating a solutions page**

I see we have subpages for design, government, marketing, and software under `solutions/`. The CTAs can definitely link to those routes, which is great! I should probably create a reusable component in `/components`, though it’s optional for this task. The user's request is to create a solutions page in `page.tsx`, using TypeScript, Next.js `Link`, and maybe `Image`. I'll ensure it's minimal, accessible, and free of linter errors. It seems like I need to create a small todo list with 2-3 items, like implementing cards, wiring CTAs, and ensuring responsiveness. I'll track this with `todo_write`, then proceed with my edits. After that, I’ll run `read_lints` and mark the todos as completed.
**Implementing card array**

I'm planning to implement an array of cards that includes titles, two lines of description, hrefs, image alt text, and possibly background colors. I can create a simple placeholder SVG generator function to return a data URL sized for a 16:9 aspect ratio. While I could instead use a `div` with a gradient background, I want to follow the performance rule by utilizing Next.js Image for proper optimization, even for placeholders. I’ll use an inline SVG string with a gray background and the text "Placeholder," ensuring to encode it correctly. I’ll also set `width` and `height` for the Next.js Image component while managing the classNames and parent overflow correctly.
**Setting up Tailwind classes**

I’m planning to use Tailwind classes based on v4 to create a grid layout. I’ll set up the grid with `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6`. Each card will have the classes `rounded-xl overflow-hidden border bg-[var(--surface)]`. I'm unsure about color variables, but I'll keep it minimal by using a default `border` with `bg-background`. While they prefer CSS variables, using neutral colors like `bg-white dark:bg-neutral-900` could be a good compromise. I’ll ensure to maintain the existing 2-space indentation style in the file and replace its content. Finally, I’ll implement the CTA link with the text "See how it works →" as a `Link`, adding an aria-label for accessibility.</details></think>

---

I'll create a structured todo to implement the solutions grid with image placeholders and CTAs, then update `app/solutions/page.tsx` accordingly, and finally check for linter issues.

**Implementing page edits**

I need to edit app/solutions/page.tsx according to the request. I'll follow the Next.js app router with TSX and Tailwind v4. For each card, I'll use large placeholder images and a CTA button with "See how it works →," linking to existing subroutes like design, government, marketing, and software. We should avoid inline styles and replace them with proper Tailwind classes. Finally, I'll create a grid layout with headings, two bullet points per category, and the required images.
**Choosing placeholder images**

The user requested large placeholder images for each card, and I can achieve that using a div with aspect-[16/9] and a background color of bg-muted. Tailwind v4 provides new classes, but I’ll stick to the standard for consistency. I'll avoid using custom text sizes, following the guidelines in globals.css instead. For the CTA button, I can utilize the `CTALink.tsx` component for the "See how it works →" link. Let’s check the props in CTALink.tsx to confirm everything aligns.</details></think>

---

I'll scan `app/components/CTALink.tsx` to use the existing CTA component correctly, then update `app/solutions/page.tsx` to build the responsive grid with cards, placeholders, and CTAs linking to each subroute.

**Considering image placeholders**

I’m thinking there might not be specific images needed. Perhaps we can utilize placeholders using a div with an aspect ratio and a gradient background or inlined SVGs. I want to keep it simple—using a basic div with Tailwind CSS for the style may be effective. The rule mentions implementing optimization with the Next.js Image component. So, I’ll create a tiny SVG as a data URI for each card category, ensuring I include alt text and maintain a responsive grid layout.
**Planning layout and components**

I’m planning to have a responsive grid layout: one column on mobile, two columns at medium and large sizes. It seems like a layout of 1-2-2 will work well. Each tile will feature a title and a description based on bullet points from the user. I need to stick with Tailwind v4 classes and not create custom text sizes. I’ll also implement TypeScript and use functional components along with the `next/image` for images. For backgrounds, I’ll generate an SVG using the category name.
**Implementing spacing and todos**

I’m focusing on consistent padding and spacing using the container class `px-6 py-12 md:py-16`. While I’m not checking the globals, I think that’ll work fine. I need to update todos after making edits and run read_lints afterward. I should mark the todo as in progress and then update grid and CTAs once I'm done with edits, leaving accessibility pending. I’ll ensure to follow two spaces for indentation and single quotes throughout the code. Lastly, I’ll create an array of solutions and a function `buildPlaceholderSvg(title)` to generate a data URI for placeholder images.
**Implementing image layout**

I’m planning to use `Next/Image` for layout, specifying width and height to ensure proper rendering. I can set `sizes='(min-width: 768px) 50vw, 100vw'` along with the class `w-full h-auto aspect-[16/9] object-cover`. Because `Next/Image` requires these dimensions unless using fill, I’ll set width to 1200 and height to 675. Next, I’ll implement the card container with a border, rounded corners, and a hover shadow. Now, I’m ready to proceed with applying the patch.</details></think>

---

I'm going to implement the responsive solutions grid with large placeholder images and CTAs, using `CTALink` and `next/image`, then mark the grid task complete and wire the CTAs to existing subroutes.

I implemented the responsive solutions grid with large image placeholders and CTAs.

- Built the grid with four tiles: Marketing Teams, Design Teams, Software Teams, Government & Public Sector
- Each card includes a large 16:9 placeholder image, headline, two bullet lines, and a CTA: “See how it works →”
- CTAs link to `/solutions/marketing`, `/solutions/design`, `/solutions/software`, `/solutions/government`
- Mobile-first, accessible structure; uses `next/image` for performance and existing `CTALink` styling

Status:
- Completed Build responsive solutions grid with cards and placeholders
- Started Wire CTAs to existing solution subroutes
- Next I'll verify mobile-first spacing and accessibility

Notes:
- If you want actual images instead of SVG placeholders, provide assets or target paths and I’ll wire them in.
