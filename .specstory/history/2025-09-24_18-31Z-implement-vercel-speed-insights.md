**Incorporating SpeedInsights**

I need to add the SpeedInsights component into app/layout.tsx. The dependency is already installed, so I’ll import it using `import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/next'` and place `<SpeedInsights />` inside the body. I might also need to consider adding it to pages under the company sublayouts, but I think the root layout is enough. Following the TypeScript rules, I'll skip using a todo since it's a simple task, but I must provide a status update before making changes. I'll read the file first before applying the patch.
**Executing Read Lints**

I need to run read_lints on the files I’ve changed, as per the rules. It’s essential to follow the formatting guidelines too. So, I’ll go ahead and read the file now to check for any linting issues that might need addressing. Once I’ve done that, I’ll provide a minimal summary at the end to recap what I’ve learned or fixed. Let's make sure everything's clear and neat!</details></think>

I'll add the Speed Insights component to the root layout so it's included across all routes, then verify there are no linter issues.

**Finalizing code edits**

I need to confirm the indentation style—looks like the file uses two spaces for that. So, I'll make sure to apply the same. I also need to add the import line for SpeedInsights after the existing imports. Before closing the body, I should include the <SpeedInsights /> component right after the children. Although it's likely unnecessary for Next 13+, I might still need to include React import. Once that’s done, I’ll run read_lints on the file, applying any necessary patches.</details></think>

- I added `@vercel/speed-insights` to the root layout so it runs across all routes and pages.
- No linter issues were introduced.

Summary:
- Edited `app/layout.tsx` to import and render `SpeedInsights` after `children`.
